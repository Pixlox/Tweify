# Tweify for iOS and iPadOS
A simple goal-tracking app made in SwiftUI to help you reach your goals faster.

Inspired by the now taken-down Reify; a near drop-in replacement, with all the bells and whistles and _more_.

> Reify? Two-eify? Tweify. (I'm sorry.)

## Distribution
Tweify is _not_ published on the App Store. Self-deploy if you have a Mac. But, to be honest, if you do, it'd be better to try out the [macOS version](https://github.com/Pixlox/Tweify/tree/macos).
